# Island Perimeter Project

For the "Island Perimeter" project, I applied my knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal was to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid was represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and applying logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation was crucial for this task.

## Concepts Applied

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)

- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
- Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

### Conditional Logic

- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### Counting Techniques

- Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

## Problem-Solving Strategies

- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

## Python Programming

- Utilizing nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- Using conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

Throughout the project, I implemented these concepts and strategies in Python to effectively calculate the perimeter of the island within the given grid.
